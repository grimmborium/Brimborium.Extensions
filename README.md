# Brimborium.Extensions

Extensions for ASP.net core


The projects.

## Brimborium.Extensions.Http

The HttpClientGenerator is a factory for HttpClient. 
The configuration is dynamic not bound the boot time.
This is called generator to avoid confusion / naming clash with HttpClientFactory.

The base is HttpClientFactory, but I had no idea how to use it with dynamic adding, changing & removing connection parameter.


## Brimborium.Extensions.Http.Sample-Client & Brimborium.Extensions.Http.Sample-Server
	
The two projects should provide an idead how to use HttpClientGenerator.



The other projects are experimental don't use it.
